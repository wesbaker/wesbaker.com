I want to find the right game for me. I really want it to be one game and I want there to be a ton of material and support for it. In order to so do, I need to play many different kinds of games, so I find myself looking into other games and wanting those. From there, my collection grows and I want to read what I have. Once I've read them, I want to play them. However, there's a parallel path here where I find myself looking at a mountain of books and I want to get rid of some of them.

So it's a cycle: want to find the right game ➡ want to buy ➡ want to read ➡ want to play ➡ want to downsize ➡ want to find the right game.

Ultimately though, the drive that keeps this up is that I want to have fun with my friends and family and tell a good story.
