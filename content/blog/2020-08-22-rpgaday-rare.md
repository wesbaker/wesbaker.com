Magic items, ones that really change the game up and make things easier, should be _rare_. Now, that doesn't mean that the party only sees one for the entire campaign, but if they're drowning in loot like it's a game of Diablo III, you're probalby missing the point. Additionaly, _boring_ magic items should be _rare_, but interesting magic items--the kind that have upsides _and_ downsides--should be less rare. Getting a **Sword, +2** shouldn't happen that often, but maybe in their first outing they find a sword that sings when the person holding it lies. Maybe they get a shield that can never get wet. Or is it a rope that can be rejoined after being cut. Weird magic items where the players have to think about how to use them are usually more fun than a sword that just makes it easier to hit and does a smidge more damage. Make boring items _rare_.
