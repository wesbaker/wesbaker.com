Ultimately the reason that I GM and play RPGs is because of the experience of playing in them and the stories they create. I was initially drawn to RPGs because I had been playing a lot of board games and noticed two things:

1. I really loved games that produced stories we could laugh about later. [Cosmic Encounter](https://www.cosmicencounter.com/42ndanniversary) in particular does this for me (and is my favorite board game as a result).
2. I kept trying different dungeon crawling board games hoping they'd give me everything that an RPG could and every single one failed in some way or another.

RPGs offer character progression, flexibility, a tactical game if you want it or not, a game about emotions or not, a chance to use funny voices, a way to tell a funny/serious/terrifying story, and a chance to be with friends. They offer a lot and that's why I'll keep playing them and keep reading about every single one I can get my hands on.
