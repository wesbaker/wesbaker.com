A forest makes for an excellent first stop on your adventure. Forests are close enough to home, but can have many unexplored paths and places. There could be a ruined church or a pastoral glade that is intersected by a ley line. They could encounter bandits or a fellow adventuring party. Maybe they're been sent into the forest to bring the local witch back for healing or for crimes committed against the church. Maybe this forest has a group of elves that make their home in the boughs and protect those who enter the forest as long as they mind their manners.

Better yet, when the party is done they have options. They're not so far from home that they can't go right back and recover--they can even do so in the middle of the adventure if supplies (or hirelings) are needed. Then again, maybe they want to see more of the world and this was the first step away from home. They've made it this far and proven to themselves that they can do this. Well, the world's your oyster, where do you want to head?
