Now, unlike shade, light is a force for good. No thieves or assassins to be found there. Instead, there's only the sunny road before you and the pack slung over your back and maybe a few fellows at your side. Honest people work in the light (and in most cases have seen the metaphorical light, maybe literally). There's almost always someone who is righting the wrongs and making the world a better place, so long as you believe in what is right and true, I suppose.

Light is also a sign of hope where there is only shade. A sputtering torch, or a hooded lantern casting light in a cavern of unknown evils, lighting the way for a party who only wants to make things better for everyone else by removing the world's blights. They plunge to the depths and excise that which preys upon the innocent and only thinks for itself. That kind of light _is_ a force for good both in and out of the game.
