A lot of campaigns start with the same few words:

> You all meet in a tavern...

This is a _perfectly acceptable way_ to start a session, one-shot, or campaign. There's nothing wrong with it. It works precisely because it's such a trope and it lets everyone get started with as little baggage as possible. _However_, what if they met on the battlefield, scrabbled together from the remainder of several companies that have otherwise been wiped out? What if they meet in an escape pod hurtling from a ship being attacked? There's nothing saying meeting has to be calm.

They don't even have to be on the same side initially (if your players are up for that). What if they meet doing the opposite job (e.g. one is stealing something and another is protecting that same thing)?

What if all the players meet after dying and make a deal with death? That'd be a fun game trying to earn your life back, or maybe just becoming an assistant to death...
