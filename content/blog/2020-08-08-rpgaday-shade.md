You know what has a lot of shade? A dungeon, right where you should be. Why? High adventure! Treasure! Discoveries untold! Camaraderie! It's here where you'll run into new problems and new people, things that will make you ponder possible solutions and alternatives. You'll try to find that solution that crosses all of the t's and dots all of the i's, but not everyone can walk away happy all the time. Sometimes, you'll need to break a few eggs--or burn a few bridges--in order to get what you (think you) want.

But back to shade! Do you know who likes shade? Thieves, rogues, assassins, ne'er-do-wells, and cads of all fashions. These folk keep to those shadows, those places of eternal shade, and they ply their trade from there. They'll take those treasures, they'll kill their enemies unseen, and they'll go right back from whence they came. Right back into the shade.
