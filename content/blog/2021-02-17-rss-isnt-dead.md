I’m not the first person to write that headline, nor will I be the last, but it’s pretty clear that people forget (or never knew) that RSS is a thing. If you haven’t heard of RSS feeds before, they stand for Really Simple Syndication, which may not tell you what they do. They’re XML feeds with content from a website. They can be created statically or generated from an application (e.g. Wordpress or Gatsby). In fact, [this website has an RSS feed](https://www.wesbaker.com/rss.xml) and I’m not sure I’d built a blog without one.

## Why?

But why would you want to use RSS?

- Twitter is a firehose where things easily get lost
- Bookmarks require you to regularly visit
- Individual web sites can be cluttered and hard to read
- You want all of the content you like in one place

You become the curator of the content you want to see, not the people you’re following. For some, RSS _replaces_ Twitter or Facebook, but for others it simply supplements it. For me, I go back and forth on whether I bother with Social Media, but for the moment I'm on Twitter here and there.

## How?

Okay, you’ve decided you want to try it, what do I recommend as next steps? There are numerous options, but [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com) is the best option I’ve found so far. It's a paid service, but I find it to be worth the cost for two reasons:

1. Actions: you can setup automations to mark items as read or starred based on certain conditions.
2. Newsletter email address: an email address is created that imports all content into Feedbin so you can read those newsletters with everything else in your feed reader.
3. Twitter: you can subscribe to a Twitter feed _in_ Feedbin. I highly recommend combining this with Actions to cut down on the noise.

I also recommend using a feed reader in addition to the service and I really like [Reeder](https://reederapp.com). Again, it’s paid, but it's been the smoothest feed reader experience I've found and even though I've tried other apps like [NetNewsWire](http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/) and [Unread](https://www.goldenhillsoftware.com/unread/), I always end up back with Reeder. As a side benefit, if you’re not interested in paying for Feedbin (and I suggest you at least try the trial), Reeder can use iCloud to synchronize your feeds and read items between your iOS and macOS devices.

## What?

You’re convinced and you’ve picked some way of subscribing to and reading RSS feeds, what should you subscribe to? This is largely up to you, but so many sites offer RSS feeds and the ones that don’t probably offer an email newsletter or a Twitter account. Reeder on macOS offers a Safari extension that allows you to easily subscribe to RSS feeds and on iOS I recommend using [Feed Hawk](https://www.goldenhillsoftware.com/feed-hawk/).
