Comfort is something most RPGs discourage because it's not the focus. Most games are focused on exploration, combat, discovery, and plunder. That being said, _all_ games should have a bit of comfort in them. Your players need that down beat to recover from the boss fight. They might need a momentary reprieve to collect themselves (and refresh their spells).

They want some comfort from obligations too. Maybe they're tired of always scrimping and saving to pay off their debt, maybe a windfall will let them put a big dent on their ship's mortgage and outfit themselves too. There's nothing to say you can't have the next mission put a big dent into their supplies and bring back the tension of supplies versus paying down their debts.

Comfort is a tool we have as GMs and we need to use it from time to time so players aren't in a constant state of worry because while that might be fun for a bit, it eventually gets old if it's the only thing they know.
