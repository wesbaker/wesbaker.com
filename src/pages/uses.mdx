# Uses

I get [no emails about what I use](https://wesbos.com/uses/), but I love bikeshedding about tools. Here’s what I’m currently using.

## Editor & Terminal

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is my editor. A younger me would be horrified that I was both using and enjoying a Microsoft product
- I mostly use Wes Bos’s [Cobalt2](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wesbos.theme-cobalt2) themes everywhere.
- I use [SF Mono](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/) for my editor font everywhere.
- I use [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com) for my terminal.

## Productivity

- Apple Reminders and Calendar are how I keep track of what to do and when to do it.
	- [Timeblock planning](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2013/12/21/deep-habits-the-importance-of-planning-every-minute-of-your-work-day/) is how I plan my work days
	- [InstaRemind](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/instaremind/id1492317385?mt=12) lets me create reminders with a keyboard shortcut in macOS.
	- [Remind Faster](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/remind-me-faster/id985555908) is a great way to quickly add reminders on the go.
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is where almost all of my notes go.
	- Apple Notes is used for shared notes with my wife (including [a squirrel list](https://hachyderm.io/@chrisgervais/109717525272033823)).
- [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com) is my quick launcher. I still have [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) installed for one single reason: Universal Actions. One keyboard shortcut to then move, copy, email, etc files from anywhere in the file system is hard to beat and Raycast has no answer to it yet.

## Reading and Highlights

- [Raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io) is my bookmarking app of choice. Long ago I used Delicious, then moved to Pinboard, and then to Raindrop. It's nicer looking than Pinboard and has an official client. I got tired of waiting for the third-party Pinboard clients to care again.
- [Readwise](https://readwise.io) aggregates highlights from a bunch of places (namely Kindle and Instapaper) and sends me a number of highlights to review every day. I can also create flashcards with the goal of retaining what I read.
- [Readwise Reader](https://readwise.io/read) is where I save articles to read later.
- [Reeder](https://www.reederapp.com/) is my RSS reader of choice. It beats scrolling through Twitter or Facebook.
	- [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com) is my RSS service of choice for <Link to='/2021-02-17-rss-isnt-dead/'>a number of reasons</Link>

## Travel

- [Flighty](https://www.flightyapp.com) tracks my flights and keeps me aware of delays and cancellations far before the airlines tell you. This has helped me get on the phone to reschedule flights before there's a huge wait.
- [Tripsy](https://tripsy.app) helps me and my wife setup trip plans and save relevant documents and reservations.

## Other Apps

This is a mish-mash of web applications and iOS applications as the lines blur.

- [1Password](https://1password.com) is where I store my 1000+ passwords and it keeps me sane.
- [Apollo](https://apolloapp.io) is my Reddit client. I try not to spend a lot of time on social media, but I like Reddit's focused communities and I can almost always find someone talking about some esoteric thing there. I also sell my used RPG books and board games there.
- [GitHub](https://github.com) should be obvious to anyone who writes code. I can remember signing up for their paid subscription a long, long time ago because I wanted to do my _little_ part to keep them around. They're owned by Microsoft now, so I suspect they don't need my help, but they offer so much for so little. Almost all my public repositories with automated testing or linting use GitHub Actions for free.
- [Hello Weather](https://helloweather.com) is a nice simple way to see the weather that I can share with my wife for one low price.
- [Opener](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/opener-open-links-in-apps/id989565871) lets me open links in various iOS applications without jumping around.
- [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/) is my podcast app of choice.
- [Paprika](https://www.paprikaapp.com) is where I keep our ~1500 recipes, our meal plan for this week, and our grocery list.
- [Parcel](https://parcel.app) is how I track my packages, though I miss [Deliveries](https://deliveries.app/en.html).
- [Personal Capital](https://www.personalcapital.com) is how I keep up-to-date with all my finances in one place: cash accounts, credit accounts, loans, investments. It's all there.
- [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com) is for when I need to edit something in a repository when I'm not at a computer.
- [YNAB](https://app.youneedabudget.com) helps my wife and I keep our budget in alignment with our goals.

### Tracking

I started off tracking what I read through Goodreads and enjoy having that record, I've since expanded it to other media:

- [Board Game Stats](https://www.bgstatsapp.com) for board game plays
- [GameTrack](https://gametrack.app/user/wesbaker/) for video games
- [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3457168-wes-baker) for books
- [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/wesbaker/) for movies
- [TV Forecast](https://tvforecastapp.com) for TV shows

### Content Blockers

The internet is a terrible place full of ads, cookie notifications, and other detritus. I try to remove as much of that as possible.

- [Hush](https://oblador.github.io/hush/)
- [Wipr](https://giorgiocalderolla.com/wipr.html)

## Home Automation

I'm firmly in the HomeKit camp at this point.

- I have two Apple TVs, one LG and one TCL HomeKit-enabled TVs
- Across the house I have 10 AirPlay 2 speakers: 2 HomePod, 3 HomePod Minis, a Sonos Move, One, Five, Beam, and Arc
- I use a Starling Hub to put my Nest devices on my HomeKit network
	- I have a [Nest Doorbell](https://store.google.com/product/nest_doorbell?hl=en-US&pli=1) for our doorbell camera
	- I have two [Nest Cam Indoors](https://store.google.com/us/magazine/compare_cameras) in our house
	- I have one [Nest Cam](https://store.google.com/product/nest_cam_battery?hl=en-US) outside
	- I have two [Nest Learning Thermostats](https://store.google.com/us/product/nest_learning_thermostat_3rd_gen) in our house
- I use [Wemo Smart Plugs](https://www.belkin.com/us/p/P-F7C063/) for holiday decorations and a nightlight in my son's room
- I'm up to [6 Philips Hue bulbs and 2 light strips](https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/products/all-products#filters=BULBS_SU)
	- I use a [Hue Tap Dial switch](https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-tap-dial-switch/046677578800) to control my office Hue bulbs
	- I use a [Lutron Aurora](https://www.lutron.com/en-US/products/pages/standalonecontrols/dimmers-switches/smartbulbdimmer/overview.aspx) to control the lights in the family room
	- I use a [dimmer switch remote](https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-dimmer-switch/046677473372) to control the bedroom Hue bulbs
- Three of our doors have [Eve Door & Window sensors](https://www.evehome.com/en/eve-door-window)
- Our front door has a [Level Bolt](https://level.co/products/bolt) so I can see if my front door is locked from my bedroom
- Our garage door has [myQ](https://www.myq.com) and I added [Homebridge running on a Raspberry Pi](https://homebridge.io) so I can tell Siri to close the garage door and setup other automations with it
- I have some smart switches around the house, namely a [Lutron Caseta dimmer](https://www.casetawireless.com/products/dimmers-switches), [Lutron Caseta fan switches](https://www.casetawireless.com/us/en/products/dimmers-switches), and a [Meross Smart Switch](https://www.meross.com/product/23/article/).

## The repositories

You can see the rest of what I'm using in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/wesbaker/dotfiles) repository. It's probably most interesting to look at the [`Brewfile`](https://github.com/wesbaker/dotfiles/blob/main/Brewfile).
