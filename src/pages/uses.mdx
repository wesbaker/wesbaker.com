# Uses

I get [no emails about what I use](https://wesbos.com/uses/), but I love bikeshedding about tools. Here’s what I’m currently using.

## Editor & Terminal

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is my editor. A younger me would be horrified that I was both using and enjoying a Microsoft product
- I mostly use Wes Bos’s [Cobalt2](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wesbos.theme-cobalt2) themes everywhere.
- I use [Operator Mono](https://www.typography.com/fonts/operator/overview) for my editor font everywhere.
- I use [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com) for my terminal. I tried using [Hyper](https://hyper.is), but had a number of performance issues that are likely unique to anyone using a terminal where there are thousands of lines being added every minute.

## Desktop Apps

- I live by [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) and have made [a number of workflows](https://github.com/wesbaker?utf8=✓&tab=repositories&q=alfred&type=&language=) for it.
- I use Apple Reminders and Calendar in concert with [timeblock planning](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2013/12/21/deep-habits-the-importance-of-planning-every-minute-of-your-work-day/).
- I use [InstaRemind](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/instaremind/id1492317385?mt=12) to create reminders when I'm at my desk.
- ~~All~~ Most of my notes go into [Bear](https://bear.app).
- My notes from meetings and 1:1s go into [Agenda](https://www.agenda.com/). It's a great way to tie notes to calendar events and have a chronological record of meeting notes.

## The repositories

You can see the rest of what I'm using in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/wesbaker/dotfiles) repository. It's probably most interesting to look at the [`Brewfile`](https://github.com/wesbaker/dotfiles/blob/main/Brewfile).
