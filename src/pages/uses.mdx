# Uses

I get [no emails about what I use](https://wesbos.com/uses/), but I love bikeshedding about tools. Here’s what I’m currently using.

## Editor & Terminal

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is my editor. A younger me would be horrified that I was both using and enjoying a Microsoft product
- I mostly use Wes Bos’s [Cobalt2](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wesbos.theme-cobalt2) themes everywhere.
- I use [Operator Mono](https://www.typography.com/fonts/operator/overview) for my editor font everywhere.
- I use [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com) for my terminal. I tried using [Hyper](https://hyper.is), but had a number of performance issues that are likely unique to anyone using a terminal where there are thousands of lines being added every minute.

## Desktop Apps

- I live by [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) and have made [a number of workflows](https://github.com/wesbaker?utf8=✓&tab=repositories&q=alfred&type=&language=) for it.
- I use Apple Reminders and Calendar in concert with [timeblock planning](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2013/12/21/deep-habits-the-importance-of-planning-every-minute-of-your-work-day/).
- I use [InstaRemind](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/instaremind/id1492317385?mt=12) to create reminders when I'm at my desk.
- ~~All~~ Most of my notes go into [Bear](https://bear.app).
- My notes from meetings and 1:1s go into [Agenda](https://www.agenda.com/). It's a great way to tie notes to calendar events and have a chronological record of meeting notes.
- Day One

## Other Apps

This is a mish-mash of web applications and iOS applications as the lines blur a bit.

- [Apollo](https://apolloapp.io) is my Reddit client. I try not to spend a lot of time on social media, but I really like Reddit's focused communities and I can almost always find someone talking about some esoteric thing there. I also sell some of my used RPG books and board games there.
- [CARROT Weather](http://www.meetcarrot.com/weather/) makes me laugh and keeps me dry when (if?) I leave the house.
- [Day One](https://dayoneapp.com) houses over 3000 of my journal entries. I write at least once daily (and usually twice daily to jot down what I did at work that day).
- [GitHub](https://github.com) should seem obvious to anyone who writes code. I can remember signing up for their paid subscription a long, long time ago because I wanted to do my _little_ part to keep them around. They're owned by Microsoft now, so I suspect they don't need my help, but they offer so much for so little. Almost all of my public repositories with automated testing or linting use GitHub Actions entirely for free.
- [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/) helps me save things I want to read later.
- [Opener](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/opener-open-links-in-apps/id989565871) lets me open links in various iOS applications without jumping around.
- [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/) is my podcast app of choice.
- [Paprika](https://www.paprikaapp.com) is where I keep our ~1500 recipes, our meal plan for this week, and our grocery list.
- [Personal Capital](https://www.personalcapital.com) is how I keep up-to-date with all of my finances in one place: cash accounts, credit accounts, loans, investments. It's all there.
- [Raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io) is my bookmarking app of choice. Long ago I used Delicious, then moved to Pinboard, and just recently moved to Raindrop. It's a little nicer looking than Pinboard and has an official client that's really nice to use. I got tired of waiting for the third-party Pinboard clients to care again.
- [Readwise](https://readwise.io) aggregates highlights from a bunch of places (namely Kindle and Instapaper) and sends me a number of highlights to review every day. I can also create flashcards with the goal of retaining what I read.
- [Reeder](https://www.reederapp.com/) is my RSS reader of choice. It beats scrolling through Twitter or Facebook.
- [Subtrack](https://subtrack.vercel.app/) helps me keep track of all of my subscriptions.
- [Tripsy](https://tripsy.app) helps me and my wife setup trip plans and save relevant documents and reservations.
- [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com) is for when I need to edit something in a repository when I'm not at a computer.
- [YNAB](https://app.youneedabudget.com) helps me and my wife keep our budget in alignment with our goals.

### Tracking

I started off tracking what I read through Goodreads and really enjoy having that record, I've since expanded it to other media:

- [Board Game Stats](https://www.bgstatsapp.com) for board game plays
- [GameTrack](https://gametrack.app) for video games
- [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com) for books
- [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com) for movies
- [TV Forecast](https://tvforecastapp.com) for TV shows

### Content Blockers

The internet is a terrible place full of ads, cookie notifications, and other detritus. I try to remove as much of that as possible.

- [Hush](https://oblador.github.io/hush/)
- [Unobstruct](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/unobstruct/id1255281426) (seems dead, I believe it's redundant with Hush)
- [Wipr](https://giorgiocalderolla.com/wipr.html)

## HomeKit

I've started down the road of home automation and I had started with Google Assistant, but recently moved over to HomeKit with the purchase of a HomePod and two HomePod Minis.

- I have two Apple TVs and two TCL HomeKit-enabled TVs.
- Across the house I have 7 AirPlay 2 speakers: 1 HomePod, 2 HomePod Minis, a Sonos Move, One, Five, and Beam.
- I have a [Logitech Circle View Doorbell](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/cameras/circle-view-video-doorbell.html) for our doorbell camera, and two [Nest Cam Indoors](https://store.google.com/us/magazine/compare_cameras) in our house.
- There are two [Nest Learning Thermostats](https://store.google.com/us/product/nest_learning_thermostat_3rd_gen) in our house.
- I use [Wemo Smart Plugs](https://www.belkin.com/us/p/P-F7C063/) for holiday decorations and a nightlight in my son's room.
- I have some [Philips Hue bulbs](https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/products/all-products#filters=BULBS_SU) in our family room attached to a [Lutron Aurora](https://www.lutron.com/en-US/products/pages/standalonecontrols/dimmers-switches/smartbulbdimmer/overview.aspx) and in my bedroom attached to a [dimmer switch remote](https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-dimmer-switch/046677473372).
- Three of our doors have [Eve Door & Window sensors](https://www.evehome.com/en/eve-door-window) so I can set off an alarm when the garage door has been open for long enough for the cats to escape.
- Our front door has a [Level Bolt](https://level.co/products/bolt) so I can see if my front door is locked from my bedroom.
- Our garage door has [myQ](https://www.myq.com) and I added [Homebridge running on a Raspberry Pi](https://homebridge.io) so I can tell Siri to close the garage door and setup other automations with it.
- I have some smart switches around the house, namely a [Lutron Caseta dimmer](https://www.casetawireless.com/products/dimmers-switches) and a [Meross Smart Switch](https://www.meross.com/product/23/article/).

## The repositories

You can see the rest of what I'm using in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/wesbaker/dotfiles) repository. It's probably most interesting to look at the [`Brewfile`](https://github.com/wesbaker/dotfiles/blob/main/Brewfile).
