# Now

This is [a now page](https://nownownow.com/about).

## Writing Code and Managing a Team

I currently work at [Kuali](https://kuali.co). I’m an engineering manager which means I manage a team, write code, and work with product, design, and engineering to deliver a compelling product.

## Personal Projects

I write and maintain a number of personal programming projects to scratch various itches I have:

- [Syncing GitHub Stars to Pinboard](https://github.com/wesbaker/github-pinboard-star-sync)
- Sending board game plays to [Slack](https://github.com/wesbaker/nemeslack) and [Discord](https://github.com/wesbaker/nemecord)
- Running two Twitter Bots for [ENWorld.org](https://github.com/wesbaker/enworld-twitterbot) and [Tenkar’s Tavern](https://github.com/wesbaker/tenkarstavern-twitterbot) (two RPG news sites)
- And [a](https://github.com/wesbaker/alfred-goodreads-workflow) [whole](https://github.com/wesbaker/alfred-stardewvalleywiki) [bunch](https://github.com/wesbaker/alfred-kickstarter-workflow) [of](https://github.com/wesbaker/alfred-boardgamegeek) [Alfred](https://github.com/wesbaker/alfred-dndbeyond-workflow) [workflows](https://github.com/wesbaker/alfred-drivethrurpg)

## 3D Printing

This is my newest hobby, and therefore, the one I’m most into at the moment. I bought a [Prusa i3 MK3S](https://www.prusa3d.com/original-prusa-i3-mk3/), [an EPAX X1](https://epax3d.com/products/epax-printer), and [a Sonic Mini 4K](https://phrozen3d.com/products/sonic-mini-4k-resin-3d-printer-phrozen) and unless they’re broken, they’re probably printing something.

## Roleplaying Games

Before 3D printing, roleplaying were my newest hobby and I still do a fair amount of reading and playing, but I've started to decrease the number of games I run and play in to a reasonable number. I still very much enjoy it, but I'm more realistic about how much I can actually play these days. I always want more though because there's so much out there.

## Board Games

Before all of the above, there were board games and I still play them, but I've reached the point in the hobby and my life where I'm generally playing (and buying) fewer games. I used to buy nearly 100 games a year (and resell a bunch of those) and now I generally buy less than 10 in a year, which is still a lot. Additionally, members of my game group have moved away and kids can make playing games just a little bit harder.
